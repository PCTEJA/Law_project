On contrary, appears injuries suffered caused firing policemen surrounded fired car indiscriminately caution ignoring danger cross-fire uncontrolled firing. It has, fact, pointed Mr. Sharan ACP Rathi written superiors pointing ineptitude team officers told staff available. The present case illustrates proves adage weapon hands ill trained individual danger Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 36 means defence. In background, evidence PW\\'s Geeta Ram Sharma, Sayeed Ahmad Shah Nawaz, PW-50 Constable K.K.Rajan PW-51 Constable Rajinderan Pilley extremely relevant. PW-13 ASI Ombir Singh Officer In-Charge PCR Gypsy parked near Fire Station Building adjoining Barakhamba Road, undoubtedly supported defence version single shot followed volley. Constable Rajan Constable Pilley, present ASI Ombir Singh, categorically stated heard single continuous firing brought rushing site having reached there, taken victims R.M.L. Hospital. Their story corroborated evidence newspaper employees. Tarunpreet Singh PW categoric shot fired inside car. The story Jagjit Singh fired police party accosted is, therefore, face it, unacceptable. In overall scenario assumed driver\\'s window Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 37 broken contended defence, effect prosecution story. We come question recovery 7.65 mm bore pistol allegedly Jagjit Singh fact intimately connected defence version. First foremost, appears prior arrival PW-42 SHO Niranjan Singh, Car searched site violated cell phone belonging victims picked appellant ASI Ashok Rana handed SHO. The fact undue taken offending police officials clear Ex. P/10 photograph showing ASI looking car. More significantly, however, PW-12 Sant Lal, official Photographer Delhi Police, took photographs Ex. PW12/28 PW12/29 driver\\'s seat close range pistol shells. Even significantly ACP Rathi submitted detailed written report Ex.D.16/8 1st April 1997 superior officer talks firing Jagjit Singh makes Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 38 mention recovery pistol car defence story weapon picked SHO soon incident. Likewise, report Ex. PW-42/C lodged Inspector Anil Kumar appellant Connaught Place Police immediately incident, reference whatsoever presence 7.65 mm pistol car. It relevant pistol sent Central Forensic Science Laboratory PW-46 S.K.Chadha examined weapon, identifiable finger prints thereon. The cumulative effect evidence reveals starkly patent fact defence story projected palpably false police officials involved having realized immediately incident (perhaps questioning Tarunpreet Singh-PW) horrific mistake, immediately set creating false defence. The trial court High Court accordingly opined basis overall assessment defence version concoction prosecution story Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 39 unprovoked firing appellants led death Jagjit Singh Pradeep Goyal grievous gun shot injuries Tarunpreet Singh, proved record. This finding completely dislodges Mr. Subramaniam\\'s argument case defence, laid, entirely acceptable, accused entitled claim benefit Exception 3 Section 300 Indian Penal Code. This Exception pre-supposes public servant causes death, good faith discharge duty public servant ill-will person death caused. In light fact positive case set defence rejected trial court, High Court us, question good faith arise. On contrary, opinion appellants fired provocation Esteem Car killing innocent persons injuring one. As mentioned above, obligation prove exception preponderance probabilities lies defence. Even Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 40 touchstone defence succeed. It true High Court acquitted appellants planting 7.65 mm bore pistol car. However, acquittal rendered ground possible pinpoint culprit so. This can, stretch imagination, taken mean story pistol planted car disbelieved High Court. The reliance defence Mohan Singh\\'s case James Martin\\'s Case (supra) is, therefore, irrelevant facts case. It true Prosecution bound evidence witnesses held Javed Masood\\'s case. In present matter, however, recovery 7.65 mm weapon appears admitted fact, rider planted help defence. The argument CBI conducted partisan motivated investigation, based largely premises; firstly, independent witnesses statements recorded Section 161 Cr.P.C. site, brought evidence, secondly, Constables Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 41 Sunil Kumar Subhash Chand suffered gun shot injuries CBI tried create evidence injuries consequence firing co-appellants effort bullet recovered ashes Jagjit Singh cremation fired weapon carried Head Constable Mahavir Singh, thirdly, Dr. V. Tandon extracted bullet hand Constable Sunil Kumar, cited witness. As this, learned ASG pointed necessary produce person statement recorded Section 161 incident admitted defence, counter version pleaded, Court called decide versions correct, background witnesses material examined. It pointed bullet allegedly recovered ashes Jagjit Singh, handed Sub- Inspector Ram Dutt Haryana Police turn Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 42 handed investigating officer CBI such, CBI recovery. It true witnesses examined circumstances necessary. It seen prosecution story, appellants Sunil Kumar Subhash Chand, caused injuries shots fired weapons Head Constable Tej Pal Singh Constable Kothari Ram appellants. As report CFSL Ex.P/37F, bullet recovered person Constable Sunil Kumar fired .380 revolver Head Constable Tej Pal Singh evidence PW-37 Roop Singh, possibility metallic bullet embedded person Constable Subhash Chand appellant steel core portion shattered 7.62 mm bullet weapon Constable Kothari Ram. Much argument has, however, learned defence counsel evidence PW-37 Roop Singh doubt expressed identity bullet allegedly recovered hand Constable Sunil Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 43 Kumar. He stated examination-in-chief received parcel No.12 covering letter dated 7th April, 1997 referring bullet recovered Sunil Kumar\\'s hand. He stated opened parcel .380 calibre bullet object re- sealed bullet parcel. It appears evidence PW-37 parcel No.12 opened Court stage contain .380 calibre bullet fired 7.65 mm bullet. The witness, however, stated parcel received Ballistics Department Biology Department Laboratory, 7.65 mm bullet it. A pointed question explain presence 7.65 mm bullet parcel No.12. In answer question, stated under: \"When parcel opened earlier hearing time .380 bullet exhibited bullet i.e. 7.65 mm (Ex.PW37/24) lying table, circumstances said 7.65 mm bullet exhibited.\" Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 44 Taken aback unforeseen development, prosecution filed application dated 4th December 1999 clarification. A reply thereto filed defence 4th January 2000. On re-examination, witness suggested 7.65 mm bullet mixed .380 bullet Advocate parcel opened Court earlier date court proceedings. In light fact trial court High Court held (and held us) shot fired inside car 7.65 mm pistol, possibility 7.65 mm bullet parcel suspect appears mischief played out. We notice dealing appellants police officials trial court clearly hinted appeared connivance appellants investigation. In case, creation confusion vis- `-vis bullets, matter undoubtedly help defence presumption raised Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 45 stage managed defence. This aspect ignored. The argument raised learned counsel appellants, therefore, application filed clarification withdrawn prosecution shying away truth sustainable happened light clarification given PW-37 Roop Singh. Nothing ominous sinister read this. The learned counsel challenged recovery bullet ashes Jagjit Singh. This submission based evidence PW-8 Didar Singh, elder brother Jagjit Singh PW-49 ASI Ram Dutt bullet handed Didar Singh statements Dr. G.K.Sharma PW-24 Yashoda Rani X-rayed dead body image bullet therein. It accordingly argued brainchild CBI crude attempt inculpate Constable Mahavir Singh. The trial court accepted prosecution story spent bullet recovered ashes Jagjit Singh. This prosecution story has, however, Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 46 rejected High Court observing trial court ignored evidence score Didar Singh PW-8 stated picked bullet ashes handed Sub-Inspector Ram Dutt particularly doctors X-rayed dead body trace bullet. We endorse finding High Court light uncertain evidence score allege CBI officials hand planting bullet, unwarranted. It seen evidence PW-49 Ram Dutt Jagjit Singh cremated 2nd April 1999 bullet recovered day ashes collected handed day sealed deposited Malkhana. The CBI, stage, recovery bullet PW-72 Inspector Sumit Kumar CBI taken possession duly sealed vide Memo Ex. PW49/A dated 11th April, 1999. It relevant weapon bearing Butt No.518 carried Head Constable Mahavir Singh seized Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 47 Delhi Police 1st April 1997 CBI access enabled create false evidence score. We recall police party comprised 15 personnel. Only 10 played active role prosecuted. This background points fair investigation. We are, therefore, opinion fault whatsoever investigation CBI. The primary argument, however, appellants assuming prosecution story correct, common intention appellants commit murder, examined. Highlighting role attributed appellants ACP Rathi Inspector Anil Kumar, submitted ACP Rathi fired car fact sitting 20 meters away firing site. Mr. Lalit, appearing Inspector Anil Kumar, supported argument submitted Inspector Anil Kumar fired car role attributed knock Jagjit Singh\\'s window calling step instead fired leading Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 48 nasty shoot out. It has, accordingly, submitted learned counsel finding High Court appellants guilty Section 302/34 etc. wrong. The learned ASG has, however, submitted question Section 34 IPC apply depend facts case reason, sequence events preceding incident, actual incident itself, post facto incident, taken account. We considered arguments learned counsel carefully. It bears reiteration trial court convicted appellants primary charge Section 302 read section 120-B IPC, High Court acquitted provision convicted Section 302/34 etc. IPC instead. This aspect examined background defence story projected entire police operation conducted secret manner outsider access going matter Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 49 relating Mohd. Yaseen. Admittedly, target Mohd. Yaseen, concededly notorious criminal bounty head, involved large number criminal matters. The incident happened account mistake identity Jagjit Singh pass Muslim nobody\\'s case police party intended eliminate Jagjit Singh friends. The courts clear score observed keeping mind background incident happened, outcome act self defence pursuant common intention kill Mohd. Yaseen. The possibility hefty cash reward accelerated promotion acted catalyst spurred police party rash hasty action. As role ACP Rathi Inspector Anil Kumar, High Court Rathi leader police party capacity ACP therefore, necessary forefront attack Esteem car Inspector Anil Kumar admittedly knocked window treated Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 50 likewise officer hierarchy. We seen site plan notice ACP Rathi sitting Gypsy 15 meters away car incident happened. It come evidence Inspector Anil Kumar conveyed fact Jagjit Singh\\'s Tarunpreet Singh\\'s presence Mother Dairy Booth Patparganj, ACP got police party heavily armed officers, briefed them, moved Connaught Place. It matter fact Inspector Anil Kumar followed Car Dena Bank, Jagjit Singh left car time Inspector Anil Kumar associates absolutely attempt apprehend stage counter check identity Inspector Mohd. Yaseen\\'s photograph him. Even significantly Inspector attempt identity Pradeep Goyal Tarunpreet Singh whatsoever, admittedly close wireless contact ACP Rathi. This pre- incident conduct relevant. The facts brought Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 51 reveal startling state affairs incident. It case defence car surrounded immobilize inmates prevent escaping intention Inspector Anil Kumar knocked driver\\'s window asking inmates answered firing inside car. This plea accepted reason defence rejected us. Moreover PW-37 testified bullet marks tyres remained intact incident, despite 34 shots fired car, 29 bullet holes, entry, thereon. On hand, appellants presupposed inmates Mohd. Yaseen, wanted criminal firing insensitive indiscriminate shots hit Constables Subhash Chand Sunil Kumar. The post-facto conduct appellants relevant. Inspector Anil Kumar gave report 1st April 1997 immediately incident, followed report ACP Rathi day giving counter version. This Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. \"49. Section 34 IPC carves exception general law person responsible act, provides person held vicariously responsible act \"common intention\" commit offence. The phrase \"common intention\" implies prearranged plan acting concert pursuant plan. Thus, common intention prior commission offence point time. The common intention bring particular result develop spot number persons, reference facts case circumstances existing thereto. The common intention Section 34 IPC understood different sense \"same intention\" \"similar intention\" \"common object\". The persons having similar intention result prearranged plan held guilty criminal act aid Section 34 IPC. (See Mohan Singh v. State Punjab.) 50. The establishment overt act requirement law allow Section 34 operate inasmuch section gets attracted criminal act persons furtherance common intention all. What has, therefore, established prosecution persons concerned shared common intention. (Vide Krishnan v. State Kerala Harbans Kaur v. Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 53 State Haryana\".) In conclusion, hold appellants liable conviction Sections 302/34 etc. IPC. We come Mr. Sharan\\'s connected argument regard deemed acquittal theory appellants offence Sections 302, 307 read Section 34 IPC trial court. At stage, recall trial court framed charge Section 302/307 read Section 120-B IPC alternative charge Section 302/307 read Section 34 IPC opining alternative charge, convicted appellants offence Section 302/307 read Section 120- B IPC. It accordingly contended appellants deemed acquitted charge having common intention committing murders appeal State deemed acquittal charge, open High Court alter modify conviction. The learned ASG has, however, pointed contrary view Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 54 expressed earlier Lakhjit Singh\\'s case (supra) consequence apparent discordance, matter referred Bench Judges Dalbir Singh\\'s case (supra) ruled judgment Sangaraboina Sreenu\\'s case (supra) implication over-ruled Lokendra Singh\\'s case (supra) well. He highlighted judgment Dalbir Singh\\'s case (supra) followed Dinesh Seth\\'s case (supra) cases alluded Bimla Devi\\'s case (supra). He accordingly pointed basis Mr. Sharan\\'s argument theory deemed acquittal lacking. We considered arguments learned counsel carefully. We must, outset, emphasize judgments referred cited Mr. Sharan largely basis charge offence appellants ultimately acquitted, framed therefore, possible convict accused absence charge. For example, Sangaraboina Sreenu\\'s case (supra) judgment rendered paragraphs, Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 55 Court held charge Section 302 framed accused, therefore, convicted Section 306 IPC Court noticed offence Section 306 comparatively minor offence, meaning Section 220 Cr.P.C. It noticed basic constituent offence Section 302 homicide offence Section 306 suicidal death abetment thereof. This judgment followed Lokendra Singh\\'s case (supra) similar situation existed. It appears, however, judgments looked judgment Lakhjit Singh\\'s case (supra) case Division Bench Court held conviction Section 306 IPC recorded charge Section 302 framed. In arriving conclusion, Bench observed accused notice allegations attract Section 306 IPC section comparatively minor offence, conviction thereunder recorded. On account apparent discordance opinion Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 56 issue involved, matter referred Bench Judges Dalbir Singh\\'s case (supra). By judgment, opinion rendered Sangarabonia Sreenu\\'s case (supra) over- ruled, correctly decided. Ipso facto, assume decision Lokender Singh\\'s case (supra) read correctly decided. The judgment Dalbir Singh\\'s (supra) subsequently followed Dinesh Seth\\'s case (supra). We must, therefore, record judgment rendered Bimla Devi\\'s case (supra) account cited cases, held incuriam. Kishan Singh\\'s Lakhan Mahto\\'s cases (supra) cases charge framed offences accused convicted Thadi Narayana\\'s case peculiar facts. We situation different. We notice charges framed alternative cognate offences having similar ingredients main allegation murder. Section 386 Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 58 The learned counsel appellants argued failure court putting relevant questions statements Section 313 Cr.P.C. recorded. Mr. Sharan given list 15 questions ought ACP represented crux prosecution story. It submitted account neglect court appellants suffered deep prejudice formulating defence. Reliance placed Hate Singh Bhagat Singh, Vikramjit Singh Ranvir Yadav\\'s cases (supra). It pointed learned ASG 15 questions referred largely inferences drawn courts relatable evidence record, inferences required accused. He submitted assuming omission fortiori result exclusion evidence consideration shown defence prejudice suffered accused account inasmuch Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. \"the statements accused person recorded Ss.208,209 342 important matters considered trial. It remembered country accused person allowed enter box speak oath defence. This operate protection accused cases experience shown powerful impressive weapon defence hands innocent man. The statements accused recorded Committing Magistrate Sessions Judge intended Indian Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 60 place England America free state way witness-box. They received evidence treated evidence duly considered trial. This means treated like piece evidence coming mouth witness matters favour accused viewed deference given weigh matters tell him. Nay more. Because presumption innocence favour position prove truth story, version accepted reasonable accords probabilities prosecution prove reasonable doubt false. We feel fundamental approach ignored case.\" It highlighted judgment case rendered background absence provision law enable accused story court, statement Section 342 (now 313) utmost important. The aforesaid observations somewhat whittled light fact Section 315 Cr.P.C. makes accused competent witness defence. In Vikramjit Singh\\'s case (supra), Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 61 Court dwelt importance 313 statement judgment primarily based overall appreciation evidence acquittal confined fact statement accused defectively recorded. In Ranvir Yadav\\'s case (supra) Court undoubtedly observed incorporation Section 315 Cr.P.C., position remains same, (in far statements Section 313 concerned) judgment acquittal Trial Court reversal High Court factor weighed Court rendering judgment. In case latest position law appears prejudice shown accused held entitled acquittal defective perfunctory statement Section 313. In Shivaji\\'s case (supra), judgment rendered Hon\\'ble Judges, observed paragraph 16 : \"It trite law, fundamental, prisoner\\'s attention drawn inculpatory material enable Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 62 explain it. This basic fairness criminal trial failures area gravely imperil validity trial itself, consequential miscarriage justice flowed. However, omission occurred ipso facto vitiate proceedings prejudice occasioned defect established accused. In event evidentiary material accused, court ordinarily eschew material consideration. It open appellate court counsel accused explanation accused regards circumstances established accused unable offer appellate court plausible reasonable explanation circumstances, court assume acceptable answer exists accused questioned proper time trial court able furnish good ground circumstances trial court relied conviction. In case, court proceeds footing grave irregularity occurred regards compliance Section 342, Cr.P.C., omission shown caused prejudice accused.\" The judgment Santosh Kumar Singh\\'s case (supra) effect based large number judgments court. Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 63 It clear record appellants, police officers, represented battery extremely competent counsel course evidence, entire prosecution story regard circumstances including conspiracy common intention brought witnesses subjected gruelling detailed cross-examinations. It bears reiteration incident admitted, defence sought happened different circumstances. It signally important accused filed detailed written statements matter. All facts significant background objection raised regard defective 313 statements trial court. In Shobhit Chamar\\'s case (supra) Court observed: \"We perused reported decisions relied learned advocates parties hesitation concluding challenge conviction based non-compliance Section 313 Cr.P.C. time appeal entertained appellants demonstrate Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 64 prejudice caused them. In present case, indicated earlier, prosecution strongly relied ocular evidence eye witnesses relevant questions reference evidence appellants. If evidence witnesses acceptable, conviction sustained shown appellants prejudice caused them. No prejudice demonstrated and, therefore, unable accept contention raised behalf appellants.\" These observations proceed principle objection 313 statement taken earliest stage, court good defect record additional statement matter allowed linger objections taken belatedly difficult situation prosecution accused. In case us, indicated, objection defective 313 statements raised trial court. We assume prejudice felt appellants assuming incriminating circumstances prosecution story left out. We accept Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 65 15 questions Mr. Sharan, inferences drawn trial court evidence. The challenge aspect learned counsel appellants, repelled. Before examine merits submission, need High Court held aspect. The High court observed incomplete charge- sheet filed time inasmuch statements witnesses recorded Section 161 Cr.P.C. appended therewith quote : \"and prosecuting agency had, therefore, taken adequate care filing charge-sheet time not, thus, anticipated Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. We are, however, called correctness observations High Court, intend giving opinion score. Sub-Section (1) Section 140 reproduced below: Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 68 \"Bar suits prosecutions.- (1) In case alleged offence police officer person, wrong alleged police officer person, act colour duty authority excess duty authority, shall appear court offence wrong committed character aforesaid, prosecution suit shall entertained entertained shall dismissed instituted, months date act complained of. Provided prosecution police officer person entertained court, instituted previous sanction Administrator, year date offence. This Section postulates order shelter period months referred act done, wrong alleged police officer colour duty authority excess duty authority character aforesaid, case. It must, therefore, seen act appellants said Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 70 The expression `colour duty\\' examined facts case. In Venugopal\\'s case (supra), Court held under: \"It easy act complained wholly justified law, offence view provisions S.79 Indian Penal Code. Many cases arise acting provisions Police Act law conferring powers police police officer person strictly justified law. Though Sec.79 Indian Penal Code application cases, Sec.53 Police Act apply. But Sec.53 applies limited class persons. So, task Court, question section applies arises bestow particular care decision. In ascertain act complained examine provision Police Act law conferring powers police said intended done. The Court remember connection act \"under\" provision law merely point time coincides point time act exercise powers granted provision performance duty imposed it. To able act \"under\" provision law, discover existence reasonable relationship provisions act. In absence relation act Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 71 said \"under\" particular provision law.\" This judgment followed Narhar Rao\\'s case (supra) . This Court, dealing question acceptance bribe police official object weakening prosecution case said `colour duty\\' excess duty, observed under: 72 prosecutions police officer person police officer (i.e. member Madras Fire Service, rank fireman acting S.42 Act) commenced months act complained of, act intended provisions Police Act. In case, accused police officers charged Ss.348 331 Indian Penal Code wrongly confining suspect Arige Ramanua course investigation ad causing injuries. The accused convicted Sessions Judge Ss.348 331 Indian Penal Code appeal Andhra Pradesh High Court held bar S.53 Police Act applied accused entitled acquittal. It was, however, held Court prosecution barred S.53 Police Act, said acts beating person suspected crime confining sending away injured condition police time engaged investigation acts intended provisions Madras District Police Act Criminal Procedure Code law conferring powers police. The appeal accordingly allowed Court acquittal respondent set aside.\" Both judgments followed Atma Ram\\'s case (supra) question action Police Officer beating confining person suspected Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 73 having stolen goods possession said colour duty. It held : \"The provisions Ss.161 163 Criminal Procedure Code emphasize fact police officer prohibited beating confining persons view induce statements. In view statutory prohibition cannot, possibly, said acts, complained of, case, acts respondents colour duty authority. In opinion, connection, case acts complained office respondents duties obligations imposed law. On hand, alleged acts fall completely outside scope duties respondents entitled, therefore, mantle protection conferred S. 161 (1) Bombay Police Act.\" Similar views expressed Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave\\'s case (supra) allegations police officer taking advantage position attempting coerce person bribe. The plea colour duty negatived Court observed under: \"All said present case appellant police officer, taking advantage position police officer availing Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 74 opportunity afforded letter Madhukanta handed him, coerced Ramanlal pay illegal gratification him. This said colour duty. The charge second appellant aided appellant illegal activity.\" These judgments considered Court Professor Sumer Chand\\'s case (supra) relied sides. In case, Professor Sumer Chand brought trial initiated information report acquitted trial court. Professor Sumer Chand filed suit Investigating officer police officials malicious prosecution claiming Rs.3 Lacs damages. This Court held prosecution initiated basis First Information Report duty Police Officer investigate matter file charge-sheet, necessary, discernible connection act complained appellant powers duties Police Officer. This Court endorsed opinion High Court act Police Officer complained fell Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 75 description `colour duty\\'. The learned Counsel raised argument sanction Section 197 Cr.P.C. mechanically given indicate application mind Lt. Governor. It accordingly prayed entire prosecution vitiated score. Reliance placed Mr. Sharan argument Ameerjan\\'s case (supra). This argument controverted learned ASG pointed bare reading sanction order evidence PW-48 C.B. Verma, concerned Deputy Secretary Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 76 Delhi Government forwarded file Lt. Governor, revealed material relevant according sanction given Lt. Governor. The learned ASG placed reliance S.B.Saha\\'s case (supra) Ameerjan\\'s case above- referred. We considered argument carefully light evidence record. We evidence PW-48 C.B. Verma. He deposed request received CBI according sanction prosecution appellants investigation report draft sanction order. He stated receipt aforesaid documents matter referred Law Department Delhi Administration forwarded Home Department Chief Secretary finally, entire file Lt. Governor granted sanction prosecution officials. It true certain material available CBI stage obviously forwarded Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 77 Lt. Governor, documents record documents, laid, adequate material sanction available Lt. Governor. We perused sanction order dated 10th October 2001 extremely comprehensive facts circumstances case spelt 16 pages sanction order runs into. In Ameerjan\\'s case (supra) prosecution Prevention Corruption Act (and sanction Section 19 thereof called for), Court observed sanction order construed pedantic manner purpose order required borne mind ordinarily sanctioning authority best person judge public servant receive protection Section 19 purpose entire record containing materials collected accused placed sanctioning authority event order sanction indicate proper application mind materials placed Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 78 sanctioning authority, produced Court. Admittedly, present case investigation report draft sanction order Lt. Governor reading refers entire evidence collected matter, leaving Lt. Governor option grant sanction. In S.B. Saha\\'s case (supra), Court dealing primarily question sanction Section 197 Cr.P.C. required Customs Officer misappropriated goods seized use. While dealing submission, observed under: \"Thus, material brought record stage question want sanction raised appellants, contained clear allegation appellants commission offence Section 409, Indian Penal Code. To elaborate, substantially alleged appellants seized goods holding trust discharge official duty, dealt disposed accordance law, dishonest breach trust, criminally misappropriated converted goods. Whether allegation Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 79 charge true false, gone stage. In considering question sanction prosecution necessary, criminal acts attributed accused taken alleged.\" As indicated above, Lt. Governor relevant material accorded sanction 10th October 2001. We come appeals additional arguments raised. In Criminal Appeal No. 2476/2009 Head Constable Mahavir Singh, Mr. Lalit argued 15 persons constituted police party 10 persons sent trial including ACP Rathi Inspector Anil Kumar others, armed fired shot, armed, prosecuted Head Constable Mahavir Singh fired car, case fell was, therefore, entitled treated like manner. In addition, submitted Head Constable Mahavir Singh share common intention accused. Mr. Lalit referred Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 80 question No.53 Head Constable circumstances pertaining actual incident answered under: \"I entire team. Then team left option return self defence save members public large crowd started gathering suddenly hearing faring inside car. Some members team returned fire. As I little away car, I held fire. But seeing crowd gathering prevent members general public coming close car, I fired shot air. In I heard Constable Subhash Chand scream hurt. Then firing ordered stopped. Within moments PCR Gypsy arrived. Then efforts injured send hospital. In press photographers, police PS C.P. Sr. officers arrived.\" He support arguments Panchnama Ex. B-67/2 prepared P.Kailasham, Executive Engineer, CBI 11th April, 1997 observations Shri Ohri, DSP Sri Sree Deep. It accordingly argued Mr. Lalit defence taken Head Constable Mahavir Singh fired crowd Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 81 away clear record incident happened busy locality i.e. outer circle Connaught Place, crowd undoubtedly collected. He pointed story bullet fired Head Constable Mahavir Singh 7.62 mm AK-47 rifle Jagjit Singh disbelieved High Court falsity prosecution story was, thus, clearly spelt out. We considered arguments advanced learned counsel. Admittedly, showing, Head Constable Mahavir Singh service weapon fired shot therefrom. The prosecution story fired car defence fired shot air crowd away. This argument based clear misconception account normal tendency person crime scene, (more particularly indiscriminate gun resorted to) run far away. It appears crowd collected shooting ceased. There evidence whatsoever crowd Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 82 collected firing going single shot fired volley 34 shots. We perused large number photographs site crowd gathered shooting, perfectly disciplined keeping reasonable distance away Esteem car dead bodies lying it. Admittedly also, absolutely evidence regard defence taken Constable Mahavir Singh. An effort defence elicit information behaviour crowd policemen Statesman employees appeared prosecution witnesses. Not single question was, however, aspect. We opinion story projected 313 statement supported evidence whatsoever. His case, therefore, distinguished seven accused admittedly fired car. We dealt Mr. Balasubramaniam\\'s arguments case Inspector Anil Kumar filed Criminal Appeal No.2484/2009 dealing Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 83 question common intention self-defence claimed appellant. No discussion is, therefore, required appeal. We finally Criminal Appeal Nos. 2477-2483 2009 arguments Mr. Vineet Dhanda, Advocate. It significant seven police officers admitted firing vehicle case statements Section 313 Cr.P.C. written statements direction ACP Rathi, superior officer. They accordingly sought benefit Section 79 IPC provided: \"Act person justified, mistake fact believing justified, law.---Nothing offence person justified law, reason mistake fact reason mistake law good faith, believes justified law, it.\" In written submissions filed Mr. Vineet Dhanda long judgment reserved Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 84 time fixed filing written submissions (which taken record) stand taken completely different accordance Mr. Sharan Mr. Lalit regard defence claimed appellants. Mr. Dhanda filed large number judgments aspect. These judgments cited learned counsel time hearing. We gone judgments different judgments cited learned counsel. We, therefore, deem unnecessary advert stage. We examined submissions regard Sections 76 79 IPC. We absolutely evidence firing resorted seven appellants order ACP Rathi pursuant common intention accused incident happened. It relevant statements seven appellants admissible Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc. 86 On overall view evidence case light arguments raised learned counsel parties, fault judgments trial court High Court.

Dhiyan Singh Jai Bhagwan Singh Deft. 1 Deft. 2 Ghas Ram Onkar Prasad The dispute property which, according plaintiffs, formed Shanker Lal\\'s estate. The plain- tiffs state branches family sepa- rate material times; 480 Shanker Lal\\'s death 1884 daughter Mst. Mohan Dei (the defendants\\' grandmother) succeeded limited estate. The reversion opened death October 1929 plaintiffs entitled reversioners, Mst. Mohan Dei\\'s son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her. The defendants admit Shanker Lal separate branch family. They divide property grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei possessed categories. First, property be- longed her. These properties which, according them, purchased obtained mortgages right. Next, properties belonged exclu- sively father succeeded daughter. On Shanker Lal\\'s death disputes arose Shanker Lal\\'s father\\'s brother\\'s son Brijlal (the plaintiffs\\' grandfa- ther) defendants\\' grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei. Brijlal claimed entire estate survivorship, allegation Shanker Lal died state joint- ness properties joint family properties. This dispute referred arbitration award delivered. Under Mst. Mohan Dei given suit properties absolute owner rest estate dispute given Brijlal, A division ef- fected accordingly since, say, 21- 12-1884, date award, 26-3-1941, date suit, branch separate uninter- rupted possession properties respectively allotted dealing absolute owner. The defendants claim plaintiffs bound award event estopped. The plaintiffs lost Court won High Court. The defendants appeal. The question nature award. The defendants gave Mst. Mohan Dei absolute estate.. The plaintiffs deny obtained limited estate. In opinion, defendants right. 481 The question issue simple construction. The award Ex. A-1. The operative portion runs thus: \"Having regard specifications above, Brij Lal, party, Musammat Mohan Devi, deceased\\'s female issue, second party, held entitled shares, worth Rs. 28,500 Rs. 42,482-10-0 respective- ly said properties; accordingly...two lots lot allotted party second lot second party; henceforth parties shall claim liability other; party permanent owner (malikmustaqil) share; party enter proprietary possession occupation respective share...... \" The underlining ours. We think words admit doubt, particu- larly words \"malik mustaqil\" used: Ram Gopal v. Nand Lal Others (1) Bishunath Prasad Singh v. Chandika Prasad Kumari (2). But argued award viewed certain earlier passages intention. ]he passages relied these. First, finding properties claimed Mst. Mohan Dei belonged Shanker Lal. He purchased acquired mortgages benamidar title them. Second, properties dispute ancestral rest sell acquired, help ances- tral funds arbitrator unable determine. 482 \"Furthermore, 2nd party (Mohan Dei) inher- ited property husband, she, case getting share, certainly settle Amroha father\\'s haveli abode haveli shall remain bad heretofore, way de- ceased\\'s perpetuated; positive that, Musammat, property shall devolve son, malik (owner) thereof, later de- scendant son owner thereof.\" We think passages qualify operative portion award unable agree learned Judges High Court hold do. In opinion, arbitrator confused mind regards facts regards law. His view law wrong words are, opinion, clear and, absence unambiguously qualify them, interpret usual sense. Some cases cited word \"malik\", case words \"malik mustaqil\" held import limited estate qualifying circumstances. We think pointless examine concerned document conceded words ordinarily mean thing qualified words circumstances appearing document, opinion passages circumstances relied case qualify strong, clear unambiguous words document. The learned counsel plaintiffs-respondents search diligently meaning contended passages assumptions appear face award arbitra- tor thought intended. We prepared qualify clear unambiguous language phrases dubious import coincide view calling aid assumptions fact existence guess 483 The award attacked grounds also. It urged, things, arbitrator travelled terms reference awarding Mst. Mohan Dei absolute interest. It urged Brij- lal bound son Kishan Lal, claim independent title reversioner Shanker Lal, bound, contended Kishan Lal bound plaintiffs either. But need examine points need proceed binding nature award. Even award invalid opinion plaintiffs\\' claim completely answered plea estoppel. Now conceded estoppel arise, be, first, representation existing fact distinct mere promise futuro party other; second, party, believing it, induced act faith it; third, acted detriment. It necessary deal stages consider estoppel Brijlal. It dispute laid claim property 1884. He claimed joint Shanker Lal so, Shanker Lal\\'s death entitled estate Mst. Mohan Dei right maintenance. Whether difficulty establishing claim, impossible so, wholly immaterial. The fact remains pressed claim it, able per- suade arbitrator immediate right estate. Mst. Mohan Dei, hand, resisted claim contended entitled separate exclusive possession, event, entitled absolute right property. On facts emerge evident Brijlal right hopes day succeeding 484 reversioner remote. Mst. Mohan Dei son Shri Kishan Das presumptive reversioner boy good deal younger Brijlal, Brijlal\\'s chances slim. Actually, boy survived Brijlal nearly years. Brijlal died 1889or 1890 boy die till March 1929. Had lived months succeeded plaintiffs nowhere. Now dispute, seriously pressed sides, referred arbitration. It award valid, decision fell scope reference binding character itself. Even wholly invalid, open parties say: Never mind arbitrator right wrong, decision fair sensible, instead wasting time money useless litigation, accept divide estate accordance findings. That perfectly right proper settlement dispute, bound parties certainly bind immediate parties; effect did. By conduct Brijlal induced Mst. Mohan Dei be- lieve case faith representation, acceptance award, induced Mst. Mohan Dei act greatly detriment alter position accepting award parting appreciable portion estate, obtained substantial advantage entitled enjoyed benefit rest life; credit said, attempted decision. In event, clear created estoppel Brijlal. In opinion, present case similar Lordships Privy Council decided Kanhai Lal v. Brij Lal (1). There dispute limited owner person who, un- proved claim (adoption) (1) (1919) 45 I.A. 118. 485 forward, right estate. The dispute taken courts compromised according agreement property divided rival claimants agreement given effect acted period years. Later, succession opened party compromise, stepped reversion, claimed rest estate, assigned limited owner, personal heirs. The Judicial Committee rejected claim ground estoppel held plaintiff claimed different character suit, reversioner, having party compro- mise having acted induced alter position detriment, estopped. We think fact voluntary compromise imposed decision arbitra- tor. makes difference proceeding footing award actings parties accepting need present contentions correct. It true sense question title law equally true estoppel question law. But question law grounded facts Brijlal\\'s conduct analysed entail assertion admitted recognised facts law Mst. Mohan Dei absolute lands awarded her. It assertion fact, recognition admission existence facts Mst. Mohan Dei absolute interest, induced one-third property Brijlal, true estimate facts known, right. There doubt acted detriment can, think, equally doubt in- duced faith Brijlal\\'s statements conduct induced believe accepted implications 63 486 award. But event, clear Brijlal estopped. The nature dispute de- scription given award considerable doubt, certainly dispute, true state affairs. Even arbitrator wholly wrong power decide did, open sides accept decision acceptance recognise existence facts law absolute estate properties agreed divide divide. That, opinion representation existing fact set facts. Each consequently estopped Brijlal particular estopped denying existence facts Mst. Mohan Dei absolute suit property. We turn son Kishan Lal. Brijlal died 1889 1890. At date Mst. Mohan Dei\\'s son Shri Kishan Das alive presumptive reversioner. Brijlal\\'s sons right portion estate assigned Brijlal Brijlal himself. But took possession claimed father. ]hey claim independent title them- selves, and, know, title date. They better position Brij- lal Brijlal estopped, estoppel descended stepped shoes. This Brijlal claimed property independently himself, not; claimed joint family rights evidently acted karta manager behalf family. But apart this, independent estoppel Kishan Lal. We said, right estate father died apart award. But took possession brother treated property derived benefit 487 it. They partitioned estate sold away parts parties. Kishan Lal knew award. He knew mutation effected accordance possession taken Brijlal rest retained Mst. Mohan Dei. His retention property continuing deal basis award indicated acceptance award and, therefore, acts conduct, represented also, like father, admitted existence facts law Mst. Mohan Dei absolute estate; further, allowed Mst. Mohan Dei deal estate own, she, part. acted award claimed absolute rights property assigned her. She dealt footing gifted right grand- sons, contesting defendants, 4th April, 1929. Muta- tion effected Kishan Lal raised objection. We Brijlal retained possession property entitled period years 1884 1889 1890 induced Mst. Mohan Dei representing accepted award abso- lute title rest, Kishan Lal brother enjoyed benefit 1889 1890 October 1929 Mst. Mohan Dei died, is, years, led Mst. Mohan Dei believe acknowledged title absolute estate. We doubt time Kishan Lal estopped reasons given above. Had questioned award reopened dispute Mst. Mohan Dei sued years obtained benefit property excluded acceptance award faith Brijlal\\'s asser- tion accepted it. Kishan Lal\\'s inaction years knowledge facts, evident deposition D.W. 2, Dhiyan Singh, testimony uncontradicted, acceptance estate consequential benefits, unquestionably creates estoppel him. This witness tells that-- 488 \"Kishanlal accepted award acted it.\" He qualifies cross-examination saying Kishan Lal objected witness know Mst. Mohan Dei\\'s death. The documents filed after, reason main portion statement uncontradicted, contradicted, accepted. In March, 1929, Mst. Mohan Dei\\'s son Shri Kishan Das died Kishan Lal presumptive reversioner, October, 1929, reversion opened estate vested him, vested estoppel. The question is, continue bound estoppel assumed new character opening reversion ? We doubt did. The decision Judicial Committee cited, Kanhai Lal v. Brijlal(1), is, think, clear point. Although reversioners claim consented bound. consenting reversioner estopped. This dispute alienation limited owner legal necessity. See Ramgouda Annagouda v. Bhausaheb (2) ground decision \".......but Annagouda party benefiting transaction evidenced preclud- ed questioning it.\" In opinion, principles apply case present kind. It contended, however, strength Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Gounden(3) Mr. Binda Kuer v. Lalitha Prasad(4), Kishan Lal posses- sion 1889or 1890 strength title derived father, precluded asserting rights different character succession opened (1)(1918) 45 I.A 118.

In case reversion fall till 1916. Long that, 1868, presumptive reversioners entered compromise grandfa- ther Jairam figured case obtained good deal Would entitled ordi- nary way. But compromise grandfather got anna 12 gundas share, compromise got 2 annas 4 gundas, The actual taking possession deferred compro- mise till death Anandi Kuer. She died 1885 date Jairam entitled grandfather\\'s share father grandfather dead. Jairam accordingly reaped benefit transaction. But observed extra benefit derived 12 gundas share absolute indefeasible right 1 anna 12 gundas event right title spring com- promise. Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas creditor Munniram anna left 2 annas 4 gundas sold 13 gundas plaintiffs sum Rs. 500. Now evident facts impossible predicate 13 gundas plaintiffs pur- chased came extra 12 gundas Jairam obtained compromise 1 anna 12 gundas good independent title anyway; course plaintiffs\\' 13 gundas assigned certainty 12 gundas impos- sible obtained benefit compromise. The Judicial Committee added possible assign 13 gundas certainty 12 gundas means followed plaintiffs admitted fact necessarily given benefit compromise. They right contest \\'the 490 position gamble possibility able prove contrary. Their Lordships added- \" Unless plaintiffs\\' individual conduct makes unjust place Bajrangi Lal\\'s reversioners legal rights effect.\" In case, Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Goun- den(1), Lordships\\' decision matter turned sort point: page 87. The present case different. When Kishan Lal took possession father\\'s property held virtue award title, years continued derive benefit it. Accordingly, estopped claimed differ- ent character reversioner succession opened out. It conceded estoppel Kishan Lal enured October 1929, plaintiffs, claim Kishan Lal, estopped. The appeal succeeds. The decree High Court set aside Court dismissing plaintiffs\\' claim restored. Costs High Court borne plaintiffs-respondents. Appeal allowed. Agent appellants: Ganpat Rai. Agent respondents: Sardar Bahadur Saharya.
