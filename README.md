# Law_project
My current running, law project

Every case, which is present in the court room, is to seek justice. since every individual has their own view on a particular topic, the irregularities in the views of the people lead to the conflict and make them seek the justice. In this paper, we propose a decision forecasting model of cases in supreme court of India, the model performs the process same as the legal cases are interpreted by a lawyer, the pipelines of the prediction algorithm reflects the process of a lawyer, as it will initially classify what is the type of the case i.e. criminal case/civil case, followed by checking whether the case has a previous history of a judicial supervision or not, followed by forecasting the outcome of the case whether the leave granted or dismissed by supreme court, followed by the outcome of the case i.e. winning or losing a case. This forecasting models can be a very big asset for many law firms in India, as they can predict the outcome the case easily and also measures how much effort they need to put in a case, and for the normal people who doesnâ€™t even know anything about the law, this paper will improve their knowledge about law and the working of the house of justice (supreme court).
